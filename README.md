# Image Processing and Detection Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an image augmentation pipeline and face detection system. It can apply transformations like brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments to images. It also provides face detection and recognition capabilities using pre-trained models.

***

## Features

- **Image Augmentation**: 
  - Adjusts brightness, contrast, and saturation.
  - Saves augmented images to the specified directory.
  
- **Face Detection and Recognition**:
  - Detects faces in images.
  - Recognizes faces using known encodings.
  - Annotates images with bounding boxes and recognized names.
